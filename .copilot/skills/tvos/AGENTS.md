# tvOS Design Guidelines

## Purpose

Provide Apple Human Interface Guidelines expertise for Apple TV app design. This skill covers focus-based navigation, Siri Remote interaction, 10-foot UI principles, Top Shelf extensions, media playback, and tab bar patterns.

## When to Use

- Designing or reviewing tvOS applications
- Building focus-based navigation systems
- Creating Top Shelf extensions
- Implementing media playback interfaces
- Adapting existing apps for the living room

## Key Principles

1. **Focus is everything** -- tvOS has no pointer or touch; all interaction is focus-driven
2. **Design for distance** -- assume 10-foot viewing; large text, bold imagery, high contrast
3. **Respect the remote** -- Siri Remote is simple; never require complex gestures
4. **Content first** -- TV is a lean-back, content-consumption experience
5. **Parallax communicates depth** -- use layered images to reinforce focus
